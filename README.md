OCLUIAWLLMB is a modern, smart and beautiful way to interact with the most powerful AI models in the world. Get contextual[^1], accurate[^1] and up-to-date[^1] guidance on anything from web scraping to intellectual property theft - and _everything_ in between.  

## 💪 Made by humans.[^1]
Leveraging the power of Meta's cutting-edge[^1] [React](https://react.dev/) framework, Microsoft's revolutionary[^1] [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language and ultra-modern[^1] [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) packaging, we've listened[^1] to feedback given to our competitors and created the fastest[^1], smartest[^1], and most technological AI au-pair to date[^1]. A single page application with a bundle size of only 4gb? It must be _GroganTech™️_.

## 🤖 Tech savvy.
Built on top of our proprietary[^2] AI-driven generative language modelling inference and zero-shot prompt engineering framework called _GroganTech™️_, OCLUIAWLLMB repackages code from hundreds of open-source projects from across [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) - all without having ever contributed a single pull request.

- Utilising more than 200+ of the most popular [npm](https://www.electronjs.org/) packages
- Over two million lines of code, less than 500 of which was written by [@jade-doggerel](https://github.com/jade-doggerel)
- No test coverage required, thanks to [Github CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)'s AI-powered code review[^1]

## 🎓 Go ahead. Commit straight to `master`.
Have the confidence to live confidently. Dare to be. Share special moments and stay connected to loved ones - your personal copilot will be at your side. You can be my wingman any time, _GroganTech™️_!
